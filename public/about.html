<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a self taught software engineer who has a passion for learning new things and knowing how the world around me works. Since a young age, I've always been fascinated with taking things apart to see how they work. I didn't always find out by taking things apart, and I wasn't able to reconstruct what I took apart everytime. RIP to my nintendo DS. </p>

<p>I hope to be able to contribute to my world in a positive way and leave the world a better place than it was when I arrived. I hope to inspire the next generation, may my ceiling be the floor on which they start.</p>
